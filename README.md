what it is
----------

ipfixer is a collector for IPFIX and NetFlow v9 data.
This data is captured and then stored in a MongoDB or
PostgreSQL database.


compiling
---------

The following package is required:

 * libyaml-cpp-dev

Optional packages:

 * libmongocxx-dev  at moment of writing (February
                    2022) this package is in Debian
                    in the 'experimental' branch)

 * libpqxx-dev      PostgreSQL support
 * libjansson-dev   Required for PostgreSQL

 * libmariadb-dev   MariaDB (MySQL) support

usage
-----

Note: if you get strange "out of range"-errors, make
sure you correclty configured IPFIX or NetFlow
depending on what the emitter is producing.
